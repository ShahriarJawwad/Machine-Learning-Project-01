# Depression Detection with Machine Learning  

This project predicts depression using machine learning, analyzing factors like lifestyle, health, and habits.  

## What's Inside?  
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and an optimized final model.  
- Key Features: Age, sleep patterns, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and more.  
- Visualizations: Accuracy comparison, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance.  

## Tech Stack  
Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy  


## Next Steps  
- Enhance feature engineering  
- Experiment with deep learning  
- Deploy as a web app
